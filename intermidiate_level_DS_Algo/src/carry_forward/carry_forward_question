Q1. Special Subsequences "AG"

Problem Description

You have given a string A having Uppercase English letters.

You have to find how many times subsequence "AG" is there in the given string.

NOTE: Return the answer modulo 109 + 7 as the answer can be very large.



Problem Constraints

1 <= length(A) <= 105



Input Format

First and only argument is a string A.



Output Format

Return an integer denoting the answer.



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = "ABCGAG"
Input 2:

 A = "GAB"


Example Output

Output 1:

 3
Output 2:

 0


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 Subsequence "AG" is 3 times in given string
Explanation 2:

 There is no subsequence "AG" in the given string.



Expected Output
Provide sample input and click run to see the correct output for the provided input. Use this to improve your problem understanding and test edge cases
Arg 1: A single String, For e.g 'anagram'

Q2. Closest MinMax

Problem Description

Given an array A, find the size of the smallest subarray such that it contains at least one occurrence of the maximum value of the array

and at least one occurrence of the minimum value of the array.



Problem Constraints

1 <= |A| <= 2000



Input Format

First and only argument is vector A



Output Format

Return the length of the smallest subarray which has at least one occurrence of minimum and maximum element of the array



Example Input

Input 1:

A = [1, 3, 2]
Input 2:

A = [2, 6, 1, 6, 9]


Example Output

Output 1:

 2
Output 2:

 3


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 Take the 1st and 2nd elements as they are the minimum and maximum elements respectievly.
Explanation 2:

 Take the last 3 elements of the array.



Expected Output
Provide sample input and click run to see the correct output for the provided input. Use this to improve your problem understanding and test edge cases
Arg 1: An Integer Array, For e.g [1,2,3]

Q3. Bulbs
Problem Description

A wire connects N light bulbs.


Each bulb has a switch associated with it; however, due to faulty wiring, a switch also changes the state of all the bulbs to the right of the current bulb.

Given an initial state of all bulbs, find the minimum number of switches you have to press to turn on all the bulbs.

You can press the same switch multiple times.

Note: 0 represents the bulb is off and 1 represents the bulb is on.




Problem Constraints

0 <= N <= 5Ã—105
0 <= A[i] <= 1



Input Format

The first and the only argument contains an integer array A, of size N.



Output Format

Return an integer representing the minimum number of switches required.



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = [0, 1, 0, 1]
Input 2:

 A = [1, 1, 1, 1]


Example Output

Output 1:

 4
Output 2:

 0


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 press switch 0 : [1 0 1 0]
 press switch 1 : [1 1 0 1]
 press switch 2 : [1 1 1 0]
 press switch 3 : [1 1 1 1]
Explanation 2:

 There is no need to turn any switches as all the bulbs are already on.



Expected Output
