Q1. Equilibrium index of an array

Problem Description

You are given an array A of integers of size N.

Your task is to find the equilibrium index of the given array

The equilibrium index of an array is an index such that the sum of elements at lower indexes is equal to the sum of elements at higher indexes.

If there are no elements that are at lower indexes or at higher indexes, then the corresponding sum of elements is considered as 0.

Note:

Array indexing starts from 0.
If there is no equilibrium index then return -1.
If there are more than one equilibrium indexes then return the minimum index.




Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 105
-105 <= A[i] <= 105


Input Format

First arugment is an array A .


Output Format

Return the equilibrium index of the given array. If no such index is found then return -1.


Example Input

Input 1:
A = [-7, 1, 5, 2, -4, 3, 0]
Input 2:

A = [1, 2, 3]


Example Output

Output 1:
3
Output 2:

-1


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:
i   Sum of elements at lower indexes    Sum of elements at higher indexes
0                   0                                   7
1                  -7                                   6
2                  -6                                   1
3                  -1                                  -1
4                   1                                   3
5                  -3                                   0
6                   0                                   0

3 is an equilibrium index, because:
A[0] + A[1] + A[2] = A[4] + A[5] + A[6]
Explanation 1:

i   Sum of elements at lower indexes    Sum of elements at higher indexes
0                   0                                   5
1                   1                                   3
2                   3                                   0
Thus, there is no such index.

Q2. Count ways to make sum of odd and even indexed elements equal by removing an array element

Problem Description

Given an array, arr[] of size N, the task is to find the count of array indices such that removing an element from these indices makes the sum of even-indexed and odd-indexed array elements equal.



Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 105
-105 <= A[i] <= 105
Sum of all elements of A <= 109


Input Format

First argument contains an array A of integers of size N


Output Format

Return the count of array indices such that removing an element from these indices makes the sum of even-indexed and odd-indexed array elements equal.



Example Input

Input 1:
A = [2, 1, 6, 4]
Input 2:

A = [1, 1, 1]






Example Output

Output 1:
1
Output 2:

3






Example Explanation

Explanation 1:
Removing arr[1] from the array modifies arr[] to { 2, 6, 4 } such that, arr[0] + arr[2] = arr[1].
Therefore, the required output is 1.
Explanation 2:

Removing arr[0] from the given array modifies arr[] to { 1, 1 } such that arr[0] = arr[1]
Removing arr[1] from the given array modifies arr[] to { 1, 1 } such that arr[0] = arr[1]
Removing arr[2] from the given array modifies arr[] to { 1, 1 } such that arr[0] = arr[1]
Therefore, the required output is 3.

Q3. Pick from both sides!
Problem Description

You are given an integer array A of size N.

You have to perform B operations. In one operation, you can remove either the leftmost or the rightmost element of the array A.

Find and return the maximum possible sum of the B elements that were removed after the B operations.

NOTE: Suppose B = 3, and array A contains 10 elements, then you can:

Remove 3 elements from front and 0 elements from the back, OR
Remove 2 elements from front and 1 element from the back, OR
Remove 1 element from front and 2 elements from the back, OR
Remove 0 elements from front and 3 elements from the back.


Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 105

1 <= B <= N

-103 <= A[i] <= 103








Input Format

First argument is an integer array A.

Second argument is an integer B.








Output Format

Return an integer denoting the maximum possible sum of elements you removed.



Example Input

Input 1:






 A = [5, -2, 3 , 1, 2]
 B = 3
Input 2:

 A = [ 2, 3, -1, 4, 2, 1 ]
 B = 4







Example Output

Output 1:






 8
Output 2:

 9







Example Explanation

Explanation 1:






 Remove element 5 from front and element (1, 2) from back so we get 5 + 1 + 2 = 8
Explanation 2:

 Remove the first element and the last 3 elements. So we get 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 9

Q4. Range Sum Query

Problem Description

You are given an integer array A of length N.
You are also given a 2D integer array B with dimensions M x 2, where each row denotes a [L, R] query.
For each query, you have to find the sum of all elements from L to R indices in A (0 - indexed).
More formally, find A[L] + A[L + 1] + A[L + 2] +... + A[R - 1] + A[R] for each query.



Problem Constraints

1 <= N, M <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 109
0 <= L <= R < N


Input Format

The first argument is the integer array A.
The second argument is the 2D integer array B.


Output Format

Return an integer array of length M where ith element is the answer for ith query in B.


Example Input

Input 1:


A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
B = [[0, 3], [1, 2]]
Input 2:

A = [2, 2, 2]
B = [[0, 0], [1, 2]]




Example Output

Output 1:
[10, 5]
Output 2:

[2, 4]


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:


The sum of all elements of A[0 ... 3] = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
The sum of all elements of A[1 ... 2] = 2 + 3 = 5.
Explanation 2:

The sum of all elements of A[0 ... 0] = 2 = 2.
The sum of all elements of A[1 ... 2] = 2 + 2 = 4.
