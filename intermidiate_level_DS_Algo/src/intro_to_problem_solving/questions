Q1. Is It Prime?

Problem Description

Take an integer A as input, you have to tell whether it is a prime number or not.

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 which is divisible only by 1 and itself.


Problem Constraints

1 <= A <= 106



Input Format

First and only line of the input contains a single integer A.



Output Format

Print YES if A is a prime, else print NO.



Example Input

Input 1:

 3
Input 2:

 4


Example Output

Output 1:

 YES
Output 2:

 NO


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 3 is a prime number as it is only divisible by 1 and 3.
Explanation 2:

 4 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 2.

 Q2. Is It Perfect?

Problem Description

Given the Number of Test Cases as T,
For each test case, take an integer N as input, you have to tell whether it is a perfect number or not.

A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors (excluding the number itself).
A positive proper divisor divides a number without leaving any remainder.


Problem Constraints

1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 106


Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T.
Each of the next T lines contains a single integer N.


Output Format

For each testcase, print YES if the given integer is perfect, else print NO, in a separate line


Example Input

Input 1:
2
4
6
Input 2:
1
3


Example Output

Output 1:
NO
YES
Output 2:
NO


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:
For the first test case A = 4, the answer is "NO" as sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 = 3, is not equal to 4.
For the second test case A = 6, the answer is "YES" as sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, is equal to 6.
Explanation 2:
For the first test case A = 3, the answer is "NO" as sum of its proper divisors = 1, is not equal to 3.

Q3. Summation Game

Problem Description

Write a program to find sum all Natural numbers from 1 to N where you have to take N as input from user


Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 1000



Input Format

A single line representing N



Output Format

A single integer showing sum of all Natural numbers from 1 to N



Example Input

Input 1:


5
Input 2:


10


Example Output

Output 1:


15
Output 2:

55

Q4. Square root of a number

Problem Description

Given a number A. Return square root of the number if it is perfect square otherwise return -1.

Note: A number is a perfect square if its square root is an integer.

Problem Constraints

1 <= A <= 108
Input Format

First and the only argument is an integer A.
Output Format

Return an integer which is the square root of A if A is perfect square otherwise return -1.
Example Input

Input 1:
A = 4
Input 2:

A = 1001
Example Output

Output 1:
2
Output 2:

-1
Example Explanation

Explanation 1:
sqrt(4) = 2
Explanation 2:

1001 is not a perfect square.
