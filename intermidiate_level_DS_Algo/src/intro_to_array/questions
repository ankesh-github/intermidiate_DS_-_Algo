Q1. Rotation Game
Problem Description

Given an integer array A of size N and an integer B, you have to print the same array after rotating it B times towards the right.


Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 106
1 <= A[i] <=108
1 <= B <= 109


Input Format

There are 2 lines in the input

Line 1: The first number is the size N of the array A. Then N numbers follow which indicate the elements in the array A.

Line 2: A single integer B.


Output Format

Print array A after rotating it B times towards the right.


Example Input

Input 1 :
4 1 2 3 4
2


Example Output

Output 1 :
3 4 1 2


Example Explanation

Example 1 :

N = 4, A = [1, 2, 3, 4] and B = 2.

Rotate towards the right 2 times - [1, 2, 3, 4] => [4, 1, 2, 3] => [3, 4, 1, 2]

Final array = [3, 4, 1, 2]

Q2. Good Pair

Problem Description

Given an array A and an integer B. A pair(i, j) in the array is a good pair if i != j and (A[i] + A[j] == B). Check if any good pair exist or not.



Problem Constraints

1 <= A.size() <= 104

1 <= A[i] <= 109

1 <= B <= 109



Input Format

First argument is an integer array A.

Second argument is an integer B.



Output Format

Return 1 if good pair exist otherwise return 0.



Example Input

Input 1:

A = [1,2,3,4]
B = 7
Input 2:

A = [1,2,4]
B = 4
Input 3:

A = [1,2,2]
B = 4


Example Output

Output 1:

1
Output 2:

0
Output 3:

1


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 (i,j) = (3,4)
Explanation 2:

No pair has sum equal to 4.
Explanation 3:

 (i,j) = (2,3)



Expected Output
Provide sample input and click run to see the correct output for the provided input. Use this to improve your problem understanding and test edge cases
Arg 1: An Integer Array, For e.g [1,2,3]
Enter Input Here
Arg 2: A single Integer, For e.g 9


--------------------------------------------------------

Q3. Max and Min of an Array

Problem Description

Take input an array A of size N and write a program to print maximum and minimum elements of the input. The only line of the input would contain a single integer N that represents the length of the array followed by the N elements of the input array A.

Problem constraints

1 <= N <= 1000

1 <= A <= 1000


Input Format

The first line contains a single integer N representing the length of the array A followed by N elements of the array A.


Output Format

A single line output containing two space-separated integers.
The first integer is the maximum value of the array.
The second integer is the minimum value of the array.

There is **no space** after the minimum value in the output format.
There is only a **single space** between the maximum and minimum value.


Example Input

Input 1:
5 1 2 3 4 5
Input 2:
4 10 50 40 80

Example Output

Output 1:
5 1
Output 2:
80 10
Note: There is no space after the minimum value in the output format.
There is only a single space between the maximum and minimum value.


----------------------------------------------------------

Q4. Reverse the Array

Problem Description

You are given a constant array A.

You are required to return another array which is the reversed form of the input array.



Problem Constraints

1 <= A.size() <= 10000

1 <= A[i] <= 10000



Input Format

First argument is a constant array A.



Output Format

Return an integer array.



Example Input

Input 1:

A = [1,2,3,2,1]
Input 2:

A = [1,1,10]


Example Output

Output 1:

 [1,2,3,2,1]
Output 2:

 [10,1,1]


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

Reversed form of input array is same as original array
Explanation 2:

Clearly, Reverse of [1,1,10] is [10,1,1]



Expected Output
Provide sample input and click run to see the correct output for the provided input. Use this to improve your problem understanding and test edge cases
Arg 1: An Integer Array, For e.g [1,2,3]


----------------------------------------------------------

Q5. Search Element
Problem Description

You are given an integer T (number of test cases). You are given array A and an integer B for each test case. You have to tell whether B is present in array A or not.

Problem Constraints

1 <= T <= 10
1 <= A <= 105
1 <= A[i], B <= 109


Input Format

First line of the input contains number of test cases as single integer T .
Next, each of the test case consists of 3 lines:

First line contains a single integer A denoting the length of array
Second line contains A integers denoting the array elements
Third line contains a single integer B


Output Format

For each test case, print on a separate line 1 if the element exists, else print 0.



Example Input

Input 1:




 1
 5
 4 1 5 9 1
 5
Input 2:

 1
 3
 7 7 2
 1





Example Output

Output 1:




 1
Output 2:

 0





Example Explanation

Explanation 1:




  B = 5  is present at position 3 in A
Explanation 2:

  B = 1  is not present in A.
